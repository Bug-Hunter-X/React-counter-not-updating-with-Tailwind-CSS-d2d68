# React Counter Not Updating with Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a common issue when working with React and Tailwind CSS: a counter not updating despite the state changing.

## Bug Description

The `App.js` component includes a counter that's supposed to increment every second. However, due to a misunderstanding of how React's state updates work or an improper use of effects, the UI doesn't reflect the changes. 

## Solution

The solution involves fixing the logic within the `useEffect` hook and state updates to ensure that Tailwind CSS correctly renders the new count every second. The key is making sure that every state update causes the component to re-render.
